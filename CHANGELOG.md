# Changelog

All notable changes to the smtlib-backends library will be documented in this
file.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.0.0/),
and this project adheres to [PVP versioning](https://pvp.haskell.org/).

The same stands for the changelogs of
[smtlib-backends-tests](smtlib-backends-tests/CHANGELOG.md),
[smtlib-backends-process](smtlib-backends-process/CHANGELOG.md) and
[smtlib-backends-z3](smtlib-backends-z3/CHANGELOG.md), except the version
numbers simply follow that of `smtlib-backends`.
