-- | A solver is essentially a wrapper around a solver backend. It also comes with
-- a function for logging the solver's activity, and an optional queue of commands
-- to send to the backend.
--
-- A solver can either be in eager (non-queuing) mode or lazy (queuing) mode. In
-- eager mode, the queue of commands isn't used and the commands are sent to the
-- backend immediately. In lazy mode, commands whose output are not strictly
-- necessary for the rest of the computation (typically the ones whose output should
-- just be "success") and that are sent through 'command_' are not sent to the
-- backend immediately, but rather written on the solver's queue. When a command
-- whose output is actually necessary needs to be sent, the queue is flushed and
-- sent as a batch to the backend.
--
-- Lazy mode should be faster as there usually is a non-negligible constant
-- overhead in sending a command to the backend. But since the commands are sent by
-- batches, a command sent to the solver will only produce an error when the queue
-- is flushed, i.e. when a command with interesting output is sent. You thus
-- probably want to stick with eager mode when debugging. Moreover, when commands
-- are sent by batches, only the last command in the batch may produce an output
-- for parsing to work properly. Hence the ":print-success" option is disabled in
-- lazy mode, and this should not be overriden manually.

-- correctly for our use.
-- In particular, the "print-success" option is disabled in lazy mode. This should
-- not be overriden manually.
